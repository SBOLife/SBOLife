# üìå **Professional Profile**

Backend Specialist passionate about technology and innovation, with experience in developing microservices and RESTful APIs in Python using FastAPI, Flask, and other frameworks. I have expertise in SQLAlchemy and working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), caching systems (Redis), messaging systems (RabbitMQ, IBM MQ), and vector storage solutions. I implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability, and I follow best practices for scalability and maintainability.

I have collaborated directly with SRE teams to achieve high availability and optimized production performance by monitoring metrics and identifying bottlenecks. I have hands-on experience with Git, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD pipelines, and I am familiar with cloud infrastructure, container orchestration (Kubernetes), serverless services, and Infrastructure as Code (Ansible, Terraform).

My knowledge also covers observability (Prometheus, Grafana), network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP), reverse proxy, load balancing, and information security. Additionally, I have experience with AI agents, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions.

I am constantly seeking challenges that combine artificial intelligence and software engineering to deliver impactful results. With over 25 years of experience, I operate at the intersection of Information Security and Software Development, always pursuing efficiency and automation.
